Juiz is an extremely modular IRC bot that runs on Lua.
Anyone can make their own modules which can be enabled on-the-fly.
Made by Team Unreliable Pollution: http://www.unreliablepollution.net/
Some modules are licensed as public domain, enjoy!

-- How to install:
1) Run ./juiz - this will generate a configuration file called config.
2) Edit that file, then run ./juiz again.
3) You're set!

-- How to load modules on startup:
1) Open the configuration file.
2) Add a line that says "config.modules = {}"
3) Add the name of the modules in that table, example:
config.modules = {"util", "ccmd", "data", "admin", "help"}

-- How to join channels on startup:
1) Open the configuration file.
2) Make sure the module 'autojoin' is being loaded, example:
config.modules = {"util", "ccmd", "data", "admin", "help", "autojoin"}
3) Add a table containing channels you wish to join, example:
config.channels = {"juiz", "unreliablepollution"}
